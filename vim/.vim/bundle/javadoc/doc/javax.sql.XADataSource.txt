*javax.sql.XADataSource_Description*

A factory forXAConnectionobjects that is used internally. An object that 
implements theXADataSourceinterface is typically registered with a naming 
service that uses the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). 

An implementation ofXADataSourcemust include a public no-arg constructor. 



*javax.sql.XADataSource.getXAConnection()*

public |javax.sql.XAConnection| getXAConnection()
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Attempts to establish a physical database connection that can be used in a 
distributed transaction. 



    Returns: an {@code XAConnection} object, which represents a physical connection to a 
             data source, that can be used in a distributed transaction 

*javax.sql.XADataSource.getXAConnection(String,String)*

public |javax.sql.XAConnection| getXAConnection(
  java.lang.String user,
  java.lang.String password)
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Attempts to establish a physical database connection, using the given user name 
and password. The connection that is returned is one that can be used in a 
distributed transaction. 


    user - the database user on whose behalf the connection is being made 
    password - the user's password 

    Returns: an {@code XAConnection} object, which represents a physical connection to a 
             data source, that can be used in a distributed transaction
