*org.omg.PortableInterceptor.CurrentOperations_Description*

Portable Interceptors Current (also known as PICurrent) is merely a slot table, 
the slots of which are used by each service to transfer their context data 
between their context and the request's or reply's service context. Each 
service which wishes to use PICurrent reserves a slot or slots at 
initialization time and uses those slots during the processing of requests and 
replies. 

Before an invocation is made, PICurrent is obtained via a call to 
ORB.resolve_initial_references( "PICurrent" ). From within the interception 
points, the data on PICurrent that has moved from the thread scope to the 
request scope is available via the get_slot operation on the RequestInfo 
object. A PICurrent can still be obtained via resolve_initial_references, but 
that is the Interceptor's thread scope PICurrent. 



*org.omg.PortableInterceptor.CurrentOperations.get_slot(int)*

public |org.omg.CORBA.Any| get_slot(int id)
  throws |org.omg.PortableInterceptor.InvalidSlot|
         
Retrieves the slot data the application set in PICurrent via get_slot. The data 
is in the form of an Any. 

If the given slot has not been set, an Any containing a type code with a TCKind 
value of tk_null and no value is returned. 


    id - The SlotId of the slot from which the data will be returned. 

    Returns: The data, in the form of an Any, of the given slot identifier. 

*org.omg.PortableInterceptor.CurrentOperations.set_slot(int,Any)*

public void set_slot(
  int id,
  org.omg.CORBA.Any data)
  throws |org.omg.PortableInterceptor.InvalidSlot|
         
Sets data in a slot. The data is in the form of an Any. If data already exists 
in that slot, it is overridden. 


    id - The SlotId of the slot to which the data will be set. 
    data - The data, in the form of an Any, which will be set to the identified slot.
