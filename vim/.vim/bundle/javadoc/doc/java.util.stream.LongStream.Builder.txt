*java.util.stream.LongStream.Builder_Description*

A mutable builder for aLongStream. 

A stream builder has a lifecycle, which starts in a building phase, during 
which elements can be added, and then transitions to a built phase, after which 
elements may not be added. The built phase begins begins when the 
(|java.util.stream.LongStream.Builder|) method is called, which creates an 
ordered stream whose elements are the elements that were added to the stream 
builder, in the order they were added. 



*java.util.stream.LongStream.Builder.accept(long)*

public void accept(long t)

Adds an element to the stream being built. 



*java.util.stream.LongStream.Builder.add(long)*

public |java.util.stream.LongStream.Builder| add(long t)

Adds an element to the stream being built. 


    t - the element to add 

    Returns: {@code this} builder 

*java.util.stream.LongStream.Builder.build()*

public |java.util.stream.LongStream| build()

Builds the stream, transitioning this builder to the built state. 
AnIllegalStateExceptionis thrown if there are further attempts to operate on 
the builder after it has entered the built state. 



    Returns: the built stream
