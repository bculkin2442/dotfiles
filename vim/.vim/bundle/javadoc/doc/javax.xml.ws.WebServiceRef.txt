*javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef_Description*

The WebServiceRef annotation is used to define a reference to a web service and 
(optionally) an injection target for it. It can be used to inject both service 
and proxy instances. These injected references are not thread safe. If the 
references are accessed by multiple threads, usual synchronization techinques 
can be used to support multiple threads. 

Web service references are resources in the Java EE 5 sense. The annotations 
(for example, (|javax.xml.ws.soap.Addressing|) ) annotated with meta-annotation 
(|javax.xml.ws.spi.WebServiceFeatureAnnotation|) can be used in conjunction 
with WebServiceRef. The created reference MUST be configured with annotation's 
web service feature. 

For example, in the code below, the injected StockQuoteProvider proxy MUST have 
WS-Addressing enabled as specifed by the (|javax.xml.ws.soap.Addressing|) 
annotation. 



public class MyClient { Addressing WebServiceRef(StockQuoteService.class) 
private StockQuoteProvider stockQuoteProvider; ... } 

If a JAX-WS implementation encounters an unsupported or unrecognized annotation 
annotated with the WebServiceFeatureAnnotation that is specified with 
WebServiceRef, an ERROR MUST be given.
