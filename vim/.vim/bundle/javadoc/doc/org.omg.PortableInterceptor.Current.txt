*org.omg.PortableInterceptor.Current_Description*

Portable Interceptors Current (also known as PICurrent) is merely a slot table, 
the slots of which are used by each service to transfer their context data 
between their context and the request's or reply's service context. Each 
service which wishes to use PICurrent reserves a slot or slots at 
initialization time and uses those slots during the processing of requests and 
replies. 

Before an invocation is made, PICurrent is obtained via a call to 
ORB.resolve_initial_references( "PICurrent" ). From within the interception 
points, the data on PICurrent that has moved from the thread scope to the 
request scope is available via the get_slot operation on the RequestInfo 
object. A PICurrent can still be obtained via resolve_initial_references, but 
that is the Interceptor's thread scope PICurrent.
