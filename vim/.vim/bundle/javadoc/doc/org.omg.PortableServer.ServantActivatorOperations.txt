*org.omg.PortableServer.ServantActivatorOperations_Description*

When the POA has the RETAIN policy it uses servant managers that are 
ServantActivators. 



*org.omg.PortableServer.ServantActivatorOperations.etherealize(byte[],POA,Servant,boolean,boolean)*

public void etherealize(
  byte[] oid,
  org.omg.PortableServer.POA adapter,
  org.omg.PortableServer.Servant serv,
  boolean cleanup_in_progress,
  boolean remaining_activations)

This operation is invoked whenever a servant for an object is deactivated, 
assuming the POA has the USE_SERVANT_MANAGER and RETAIN policies. 


    oid - object Id associated with the object being deactivated. 
    adapter - object reference for the POA in which the object was active. 
    serv - contains reference to the servant associated with the object being deactivated. 
    cleanup_in_progress - if TRUE indicates that destroy or deactivate is called with etherealize_objects 
       param of TRUE. FALSE indicates that etherealize was called due to other 
       reasons. 
    remaining_activations - indicates whether the Servant Manager can destroy a servant. If set to TRUE, 
       the Servant Manager should wait until all invocations in progress have 
       completed. 

*org.omg.PortableServer.ServantActivatorOperations.incarnate(byte[],POA)*

public |org.omg.PortableServer.Servant| incarnate(
  byte[] oid,
  org.omg.PortableServer.POA adapter)
  throws |org.omg.PortableServer.ForwardRequest|
         
This operation is invoked by the POA whenever the POA receives a request for an 
object that is not currently active, assuming the POA has the 
USE_SERVANT_MANAGER and RETAIN policies. 


    oid - object Id associated with the object on the request was made. 
    adapter - object reference for the POA in which the object is being activated. 

    Returns: Servant corresponding to oid is created or located by the user supplied servant 
             manager.
