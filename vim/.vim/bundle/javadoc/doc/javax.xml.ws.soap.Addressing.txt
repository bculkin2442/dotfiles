*javax.xml.ws.soap.Addressing_Description*

This annotation represents the use of WS-Addressing with either the SOAP 
1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP binding. Using this annotation with any other binding 
is undefined. 

This annotation MUST only be used in conjunction with the 
(|javax.jws.WebService|) , (|javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider|) , and 
(|javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef|) annotations. When used with a 
javax.jws.WebService annotation, this annotation MUST only be used on the 
service endpoint implementation class. When used with a WebServiceRef 
annotation, this annotation MUST only be used when a proxy instance is created. 
The injected SEI proxy, and endpoint MUST honor the values of the Addressing 
annotation. 

This annotation's behaviour is defined by the corresponding feature 
(|javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature|) .
