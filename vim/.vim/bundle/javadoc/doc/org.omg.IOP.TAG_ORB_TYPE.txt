It is often useful in the real world to be able to identify the particular kind 
of ORB an object reference is coming from, to work around problems with that 
particular ORB, or exploit shared efficiencies. 

The TAG_ORB_TYPE component has an associated value of type unsigned long (Java 
long), encoded as a CDR encapsulation, designating an ORB type ID allocated by 
the OMG for the ORB type of the originating ORB. Anyone may register any ORB 
types by submitting a short (one-paragraph) description of the ORB type to the 
OMG, and will receive a new ORB type ID in return. A list of ORB type 
descriptions and values will be made available on the OMG web server. 

The TAG_ORB_TYPE component can appear at most once in any IOR profile. For 
profiles supporting IIOP 1.1 or greater, it is optionally present.
