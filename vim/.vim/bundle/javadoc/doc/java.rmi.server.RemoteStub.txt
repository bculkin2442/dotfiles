*java.rmi.server.RemoteStub_Description*

TheRemoteStubclass is the common superclass of statically generated client 
stubs and provides the framework to support a wide range of remote reference 
semantics. Stub objects are surrogates that support exactly the same set of 
remote interfaces defined by the actual implementation of the remote object. 


  Deprecated: Statically generated stubs are deprecated, since
 stubs are generated dynamically. See {@link UnicastRemoteObject}
 for information about dynamic stub generation.

*java.rmi.server.RemoteStub()*

protected RemoteStub()

Constructs aRemoteStub. 


*java.rmi.server.RemoteStub(RemoteRef)*

protected RemoteStub(java.rmi.server.RemoteRef ref)

Constructs aRemoteStubwith the specified remote reference. 

    ref - the remote reference 

*java.rmi.server.RemoteStub.setRef(RemoteStub,RemoteRef)*

protected static void setRef(
  java.rmi.server.RemoteStub stub,
  java.rmi.server.RemoteRef ref)

Throws (|java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException|) . 

    Deprecated: No replacement.  The {@code setRef} method
 was intended for setting the remote reference of a remote
 stub. This is unnecessary, since {@code RemoteStub}s can be created
 and initialized with a remote reference through use of
 the {@link #RemoteStub(RemoteRef)} constructor.

    stub - the remote stub 
    ref - the remote reference
