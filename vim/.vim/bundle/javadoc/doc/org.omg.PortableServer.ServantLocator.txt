*org.omg.PortableServer.ServantLocator_Description*

When the POA has the NON_RETAIN policy it uses servant managers that are 
ServantLocators. Because the POA knows that the servant returned by this 
servant manager will be used only for a single request, it can supply extra 
information to the servant manager's operations and the servant manager's pair 
of operations may be able to cooperate to do something different than a 
ServantActivator. When the POA uses the ServantLocator interface, immediately 
after performing the operation invocation on the servant returned by preinvoke, 
the POA will invoke postinvoke on the servant manager, passing the ObjectId 
value and the Servant value as parameters (among others). This feature may be 
used to force every request for objects associated with a POA to be mediated by 
the servant manager.
