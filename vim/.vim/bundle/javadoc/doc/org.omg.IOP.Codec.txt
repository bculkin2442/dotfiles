*org.omg.IOP.Codec_Description*

The formats of IOR components and service context data used by ORB services are 
often defined as CDR encapsulations encoding instances of IDL defined data 
types. The Codec provides a mechanism to transfer these components between 
their IDL data types and their CDR encapsulation representations. 

A Codec is obtained from the CodecFactory. The CodecFactory is obtained through 
a call to ORB.resolve_initial_references( "CodecFactory" ).
