*java.util.function.IntConsumer_Description*

Represents an operation that accepts a singleint-valued argument and returns no 
result. This is the primitive type specialization of 
(|java.util.function.Consumer|) forint. Unlike most other functional 
interfaces,IntConsumeris expected to operate via side-effects. 

This is a functional interface whose functional method is 
(|java.util.function.IntConsumer|) . 



*java.util.function.IntConsumer.accept(int)*

public void accept(int value)

Performs this operation on the given argument. 


    value - the input argument 

*java.util.function.IntConsumer.andThen(IntConsumer)*

public |java.util.function.IntConsumer| andThen(java.util.function.IntConsumer after)

Returns a composedIntConsumerthat performs, in sequence, this operation 
followed by theafteroperation. If performing either operation throws an 
exception, it is relayed to the caller of the composed operation. If performing 
this operation throws an exception, theafteroperation will not be performed. 


    after - the operation to perform after this operation 

    Returns: a composed {@code IntConsumer} that performs in sequence this operation 
             followed by the {@code after} operation
