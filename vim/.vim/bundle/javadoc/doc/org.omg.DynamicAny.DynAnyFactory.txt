*org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyFactory_Description*

DynAny objects can be created by invoking operations on the DynAnyFactory 
object. Generally there are only two ways to create a DynAny object: 

invoking an operation on an existing DynAny object invoking an operation on a 
DynAnyFactory object 

A constructed DynAny object supports operations that enable the creation of new 
DynAny objects encapsulating access to the value of some constituent. DynAny 
objects also support the copy operation for creating new DynAny objects. A 
reference to the DynAnyFactory object is obtained by calling 
ORB.resolve_initial_references() with the identifier parameter set to the 
string constant "DynAnyFactory". Dynamic interpretation of an any usually 
involves creating a DynAny object using create_dyn_any() as the first step. 
Depending on the type of the any, the resulting DynAny object reference can be 
narrowed to a DynFixed, DynStruct, DynSequence, DynArray, DynUnion, DynEnum, or 
DynValue object reference. Dynamic creation of an any involves creating a 
DynAny object using create_dyn_any_from_type_code(), passing the TypeCode 
associated with the value to be created. The returned reference is narrowed to 
one of the complex types, such as DynStruct, if appropriate. Then, the value 
can be initialized by means of invoking operations on the resulting object. 
Finally, the to_any operation can be invoked to create an any value from the 
constructed DynAny.
