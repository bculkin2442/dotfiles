*org.w3c.dom.xpath.XPathExpression_Description*

The XPathExpression interface represents a parsed and resolved XPath 
expression. See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 XPath 
Specification. 



*org.w3c.dom.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(Node,short,Object)*

public |java.lang.Object| evaluate(
  org.w3c.dom.Node contextNode,
  short type,
  java.lang.Object result)
  throws |org.w3c.dom.DOMException|
         |org.w3c.dom.xpath.XPathException|
         
Evaluates this XPath expression and returns a result. 


    contextNode - The context is context node for the evaluation of this XPath expression.If the 
       XPathEvaluator was obtained by casting the Document then this must be 
       owned by the same document and must be a Document, Element, Attribute, 
       Text, CDATASection, Comment, ProcessingInstruction, or XPathNamespace 
       node.If the context node is a Text or a CDATASection, then the context 
       is interpreted as the whole logical text node as seen by XPath, unless 
       the node is empty in which case it may not serve as the XPath context. 
    type - If a specific type is specified, then the result will be coerced to return the 
       specified type relying on XPath conversions and fail if the desired 
       coercion is not possible. This must be one of the type codes of 
       XPathResult. 
    result - The result specifies a specific result object which may be reused and returned 
       by this method. If this is specified as nullor the implementation does 
       not reuse the specified result, a new result object will be constructed 
       and returned.For XPath 1.0 results, this object will be of type 
       XPathResult. 

    Returns: The result of the evaluation of the XPath expression.For XPath 1.0 results, 
             this object will be of type XPathResult.
