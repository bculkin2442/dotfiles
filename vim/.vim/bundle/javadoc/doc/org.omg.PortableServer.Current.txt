*org.omg.PortableServer.Current_Description*

The PortableServer::Current interface, derived from CORBA::Current, provides 
method implementations with access to the identity of the object on which the 
method was invoked. The Current interface is provided to support servants that 
implement multiple objects, but can be used within the context of 
POA-dispatched method invocations on any servant. To provide location 
transparency, ORBs are required to support use of Current in the context of 
both locally and remotely invoked operations. An instance of Current can be 
obtained by the application by issuing the 
CORBA::ORB::resolve_initial_references("POACurrent") operation. Thereafter, it 
can be used within the context of a method dispatched by the POA to obtain the 
POA and ObjectId that identify the object on which that operation was invoked.
