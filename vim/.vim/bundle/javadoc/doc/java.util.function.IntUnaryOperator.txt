*java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator_Description*

Represents an operation on a singleint-valued operand that produces 
anint-valued result. This is the primitive type specialization of 
(|java.util.function.UnaryOperator|) forint. 

This is a functional interface whose functional method is 
(|java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator|) . 



*java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator.andThen(IntUnaryOperator)*

public |java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator| andThen(java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator after)

Returns a composed operator that first applies this operator to its input, and 
then applies theafteroperator to the result. If evaluation of either operator 
throws an exception, it is relayed to the caller of the composed operator. 


    after - the operator to apply after this operator is applied 

    Returns: a composed operator that first applies this operator and then applies the 
             {@code after} operator 

*java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator.applyAsInt(int)*

public int applyAsInt(int operand)

Applies this operator to the given operand. 


    operand - the operand 

    Returns: the operator result 

*java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator.compose(IntUnaryOperator)*

public |java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator| compose(java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator before)

Returns a composed operator that first applies thebeforeoperator to its input, 
and then applies this operator to the result. If evaluation of either operator 
throws an exception, it is relayed to the caller of the composed operator. 


    before - the operator to apply before this operator is applied 

    Returns: a composed operator that first applies the {@code before} operator and then 
             applies this operator 

*java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator.identity()*

public static |java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator| identity()

Returns a unary operator that always returns its input argument. 



    Returns: a unary operator that always returns its input argument
