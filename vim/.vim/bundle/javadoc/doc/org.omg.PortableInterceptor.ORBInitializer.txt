*org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializer_Description*

Facilitates interceptor registration and ORB initialization. 

Interceptors are intended to be a means by which ORB services gain access to 
ORB processing, effectively becoming part of the ORB. Since Interceptors are 
part of the ORB, when ORB.init returns an ORB, the Interceptors shall have been 
registered. Interceptors cannot be registered on an ORB after it has been 
returned by a call to ORB.init. 

An Interceptor is registered by registering an associated ORBInitializer object 
which implements the ORBInitializer interface. When an ORB is initializing, it 
shall call each registered ORBInitializer, passing it an ORBInitInfo object 
which is used to register its Interceptor. 

Registering ORB Initializers in Java 

ORBInitializers are registered via Java ORB properties. 

The property names are of the form: 

org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.<Service> 

where <Service> is the string name of a class which implements 

org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializer 

To avoid name collisions, the reverse DNS name convention should be used. For 
example, if company X has three initializers, it could define the following 
properties: 

org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.com.x.Init1 

org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.com.x.Init2 

org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.com.x.Init3 

During ORB.init, these ORB properties which begin with 
org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass shall be collected, the 
<Service> portion of each property shall be extracted, an object shall be 
instantiated with the <Service> string as its class name, and the pre_init and 
post_init methods shall be called on that object. If there are any exceptions, 
the ORB shall ignore them and proceed. 

Example 

A client-side logging service written by company X, for example, may have the 
following ORBInitializer implementation: 

package com.x.logging; 

import org.omg.PortableInterceptor.Interceptor; import 
org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializer; import 
org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitInfo; 

public class LoggingService implements ORBInitializer { void pre_init( 
ORBInitInfo info ) { // Instantiate the Logging Service s Interceptor. 
Interceptor interceptor = new LoggingInterceptor(); 

// Register the Logging Service s Interceptor. 
info.add_client_request_interceptor( interceptor ); } 

void post_init( ORBInitInfo info ) { // This service does not need two init 
points. } } 

To run a program called MyApp using this logging service, the user could type: 

java 
-Dorg.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.com.x.Logging.LoggingService 
MyApp 

Notes about Registering Interceptors 

Request Interceptors are registered on a per-ORB basis. 

To achieve virtual per-object Interceptors, query the policies on the target 
from within the interception points to determine whether they should do any 
work. 

To achieve virtual per-POA Interceptors, instantiate each POA with a different 
ORB. While Interceptors may be ordered administratively, there is no concept of 
order with respect to the registration of Interceptors. Request Interceptors 
are concerned with service contexts. Service contexts have no order, so there 
is no purpose for request Interceptors to have an order. IOR Interceptors are 
concerned with tagged components. Tagged components also have no order, so 
there is no purpose for IOR Interceptors to have an order. 

Registration code should avoid using the ORB (i.e., calling ORB.init with the 
provided orb_id). Since registration occurs during ORB initialization, results 
of invocations on this ORB while it is in this state are undefined.
