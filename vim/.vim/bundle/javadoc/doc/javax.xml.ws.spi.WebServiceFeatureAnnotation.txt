*javax.xml.ws.spi.WebServiceFeatureAnnotation_Description*

Annotation used to identify other annotations as a WebServiceFeature. 

Each WebServiceFeature annotation annotated with this annotation MUST contain 
an enabled property of type boolean with a default value of true. 

JAX-WS defines the following WebServiceFeature annotations (Addressing, MTOM, 
RespectBinding), however, an implementation may define vendors specific 
annotations for other features. 

Annotations annotated with WebServiceFeatureAnnotation MUST have the same 
@Target of (|javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef|) annotation, so that the resulting 
feature annotation can be used in conjunction with the 
(|javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef|) annotation if necessary. 

If a JAX-WS implementation encounters an annotation annotated with the 
WebServiceFeatureAnnotation that it does not recognize/support an error MUST be 
given.
