*java.util.function.DoublePredicate_Description*

Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of onedouble-valued argument. 
This is thedouble-consuming primitive type specialization of 
(|java.util.function.Predicate|) . 

This is a functional interface whose functional method is 
(|java.util.function.DoublePredicate|) . 



*java.util.function.DoublePredicate.and(DoublePredicate)*

public |java.util.function.DoublePredicate| and(java.util.function.DoublePredicate other)

Returns a composed predicate that represents a short-circuiting logical AND of 
this predicate and another. When evaluating the composed predicate, if this 
predicate isfalse, then theotherpredicate is not evaluated. 

Any exceptions thrown during evaluation of either predicate are relayed to the 
caller; if evaluation of this predicate throws an exception, theotherpredicate 
will not be evaluated. 


    other - a predicate that will be logically-ANDed with this predicate 

    Returns: a composed predicate that represents the short-circuiting logical AND of this 
             predicate and the {@code other} predicate 

*java.util.function.DoublePredicate.negate()*

public |java.util.function.DoublePredicate| negate()

Returns a predicate that represents the logical negation of this predicate. 



    Returns: a predicate that represents the logical negation of this predicate 

*java.util.function.DoublePredicate.or(DoublePredicate)*

public |java.util.function.DoublePredicate| or(java.util.function.DoublePredicate other)

Returns a composed predicate that represents a short-circuiting logical OR of 
this predicate and another. When evaluating the composed predicate, if this 
predicate istrue, then theotherpredicate is not evaluated. 

Any exceptions thrown during evaluation of either predicate are relayed to the 
caller; if evaluation of this predicate throws an exception, theotherpredicate 
will not be evaluated. 


    other - a predicate that will be logically-ORed with this predicate 

    Returns: a composed predicate that represents the short-circuiting logical OR of this 
             predicate and the {@code other} predicate 

*java.util.function.DoublePredicate.test(double)*

public boolean test(double value)

Evaluates this predicate on the given argument. 


    value - the input argument 

    Returns: {@code true} if the input argument matches the predicate, otherwise {@code 
             false}
